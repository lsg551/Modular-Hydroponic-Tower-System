# History & License

This is NOT my own design. Instead it is based upon the work of László Dániel (Hungary). He released a remixed version from Alex Rodriguez (USA), presuambly the initial author.

The original [Thingiverse](www.thingiverse.com) sources are, unfortunately, deleted and no longer available. I don't know why, but a long, uncurated list of further remixes, improvements, modifications and knowledge about the design are lost with it. The design gathered a huge community around it.

I decided to preserve my own, but not complete copy of the sources here in order to make it available to the community again and allow discussion and further development. The initial release v0.1.0 contains a 1:1 (almost, because incomplete) copy of the original sources in the folder [`/MHTS`](./MHTS/). Future releases may contain modifications and improvements.

As far as I can tell, both László Dániel and Alex Rodriguez released their work under some `Creative Commons - Attribution - Non-Commercial - Share Alike license` license. The source files contain only a note (see [here](./MHTS/LICENSE)).

My own version is thus released under `Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)`. You can find the full license text [here](./LICENSE).
